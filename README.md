### About 
About. This is a project on skin lesion recognition. We attempt to classify images of skin lesions as cancerous or non cancerous. We accomplish this with algorithm feature extraction and a classification model.

This is a finished repository where you can finde the whole project. The final clasification model you can find here has already been trained. Classifing your images is possible following the next instructions.


### Dependencies
the following libraries are needed to run the code
 1. pickle
 2. extract_features
 3. sklearn.preprocessing
 4. numpy
 5. pandas
 6 .matplotlib.pyplot
 7. cv2
 8. PIL

Also python 3.0 will be needed.


### Instructions 

1. Copy evaluate_classifier.py in to your prefered editor.
2. input an image and a mask path into the code. If your mask is a png file, use our png_to_numpy_array function.
